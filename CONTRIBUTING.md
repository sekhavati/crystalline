# How to Contribute

Please take a moment to read through this contributing guide, doing so will help ensure the library remains consistent 
as it grows.

- Don't reinvent the wheel when a readable *native* solution already exists.
- Write functions as if you were writing a sentence. 
- Favour brevity but not at the expense of readability.
- Function categories (arrays, numbers etc) are based on the type of variable they primarily operate on.
- The category dictates the type of variable the function should accept as its first parameter.
- Functions should be [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). 
- Reuse vocabulary (alter, split etc) across categories where possible to reduce the learning curve for our users.
- Write adequate units tests.
